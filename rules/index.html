<h2>SUICIDE POOL</h2>
<p>Entry fee:$10 one time payment.</p>
<p>Pick one team to win or tie that week.No spread.If you don’t lose,you advance to the
next week.If you lose,you are out.You cannot pick the same team more than once
during this pool. Eg. If you pick Denver in week one and win,you can’t pick Denver
again.  Ever!Last one standing wins all the money.</p>
<p>There will be a magic number.This means the pool will have to get down to this #
of players or less. Eg. If the magic # is 5,there will have to be 5 or less players left
at any point during the pool.If there are 6 players left and all 6 lose that same week,
all other players will be invited back into the pool at a cost of $5,and the pool will
start over.The 6 who lost will not have to pay the re-entry fee.
The magic # will be set prior to the start of season,and will depend on the #
of entries.Picks must be in Thursdays by 8pm.If you are eliminated in the first week,you may re-enter
the pool at a cost of $20.This is only good for week # 1.</p>
